# Description
The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. In the game, the contestant is presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize) and behind the other two are goats. The contestant selects a door, and then the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens one of the other two doors revealing a goat. The contestant is then given the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door. The puzzle is whether it is better to stick with the original choice or switch doors.
